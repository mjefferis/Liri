# Liri
The goal of this program was to create a SIRI like machine but using commands instead of speech. It was  created using Node.js and works with Twitter, Spotify, and the Omdb api to cll upon data. I had to install the twitter, spotify, and npm packages to get the product fully functional. This code will not work if Node.js is not installed on your computer.

"my-tweets" will display my 20 latest tweets

"spotify-this-song" will display information regarding the song the user inputs. If no song is chosen, it will default to "The Sign".

"movie-this" will log information regarding a movie the user enters. If no movie is selected, it will default to "Mr. Nobody".

"do-what-it-says" will read a song from random.txt and log information pertaining to the song in said file.
